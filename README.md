# PROJECT TRACKER

This application combines the functionalities of a job tracker, project map, time-sheets, and SQL project database, providing a comprehensive solution for efficient project management. With its user-friendly interface and robust features, it streamlines workflow, enhances collaboration, and ensures accurate tracking of jobs and time. (Inspired by John Smilga's "Jobify").
(Note: I'm currently working on the updated MERN version of this app).
